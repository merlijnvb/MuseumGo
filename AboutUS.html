                    With our services we enable you to: <br>
                     --  better monitor your visitors<br>
                     --  manipulate visitors recommended walking path<br>
                     --  keep a better eye on your room climates<br>
                     --  attract more visitors with special events and features that our platform offers<br>
                    <br>
                    We have created a platform that will monitor visitor behaviour throughout a museum or art gallery. It does so by a implementing an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) in combination with high sensitivity climate surveillance modules.
                    <br><br>
                    Click the button below to check out our first prototype! For now we simulate only random visitor movements and base sensor values upon 1 arduino CO2 sensor.

                    What visitors can expect while using our application: <br>
                     --  smoother overall experience (walk through the less crowded rooms to have the best experience)<br>
                     --  make art interactive while touring your museum<br>
                     --  collecting points and unlocking achievements while appreciating art in other ways previously not possible<br>
                    <br>
                    To ensure you these features and experiences when going to your favorite museum or art gallery we have developed 3 games. These games are:<br>
                     --  hunting game<br>
                     --  puzzle game<br>
                     --  trivia game<br>

<!--                    The image is a bar chart titled “Visits to Dutch Museums,” which shows the number of visits to museums in the Netherlands from 2015 to 2021 (in millions).-->
<!--                    In 2021, museums in the Netherlands attracted 12.3 million visitors, which is 14 percent less than the previous year. The decline was most pronounced among foreign visitors. In 2019, foreign guests accounted for 10.3 million visitors, but two years later, this had dropped by more than 85 percent to 1.5 million.-->

<!--                    To create the best immersive and user-friendly platform we need to look into tech that enables us to precisely track a users exact indoor location. This can be done via an indoor positioning system (IPS), via NFC tech or with QR-codes. With the development and integration of Ultra-Wide-Band-chips (UWB) in the newest mobile phones multiplies the possibilities of using indoor positioning. In our case the application for indoor mobile AR games for musea.-->
