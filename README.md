For now we only have a basic website with the essentials to prove our concept as a 'business'. But for the future it would be cool to look into Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) and Artificial Reality (AR) to create fully function games so it can be tested in real life. Also gathering all necessery data from Musea or Art galeries has a crucial role to play when it comes to making these games work. So partnering with local musea is also a important step to undertake from here.
